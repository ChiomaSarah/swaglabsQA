## 📄 Documentation Deliverables

### 1. 🗂 Test Plan (`Swag Labs Test Plan.docx`)
A professional test plan document structured across three parts:
- **Cover Page** — project identity, tester, role, and portfolio link
- **Executive Summary & Metrics Dashboard** — headline results, key facts, metric boxes (49 TCs · 38 passed · 11 failed · 78% pass rate · 14 defects), severity breakdown, and pass rate by module
- **Full QA Test Plan** — objectives, skills demonstrated, test scope, 7 testing types, 5 techniques, execution order, test environment, exit criteria, defect summary, risk register, and approval section

### 2. 📊 QA Project Workbook (`Swag Labs Requirements Analysis.xlsx`)
A 6-tab Excel workbook:

| Tab | Contents |
|---|---|
| **Test Cases** | 49 test cases with ID, module, scenario, user account, preconditions, steps, test data, expected result, actual result, result (Pass/Fail/Blocked), and Bug ID |
| **Defect Report** | 14 defects with ID, affected account, module, title, steps to reproduce, expected vs actual result, severity, priority, and colour-coded status |
| **Test Summary Report** | Execution results by module, defect summary by severity, top 3 critical issues, and overall assessment |
| **Feature Inventory** | All application features documented with expected behaviour and test steps |
| **Business Rules** | 15 business rules governing application behaviour |
| **User Flow Summary** | 8 end-to-end user flows with preconditions, steps, alternate paths, and pass/fail criteria |

### 3. 🖥 Presentation (`Swag Labs Project Presentation.pptx`)
10 slides covering the full project — application overview, test plan summary, test case breakdown, execution results, defect log, top 3 critical issues, and test summary.

## 👤 User Accounts Tested

| Account | Password | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| `standard_user` | `secret_sauce` | Normal — all features work as expected. Used as the baseline for cross-account comparison |
| `locked_out_user` | `secret_sauce` | Blocked at login — lock-out error displayed |
| `problem_user` | `secret_sauce` | **3 Critical + 2 High defects** — wrong images on all cards, sort dropdown unresponsive, Last Name overwrites First Name in checkout, cart limited to 3 items |
| `error_user` | `secret_sauce` | **3 High defects** — sort triggers browser alert, Last Name field unresponsive, cart limited to 3 items |
| `visual_user` | `secret_sauce` | **2 Medium defects** — sort order non-deterministic, layout breaks on smaller screens |
| `performance_glitch_user` | `secret_sauce` | Intentional 3–5s delay on all actions — used for performance comparison |

## 🐛 Defect Summary

| Severity | Count | Key Findings |
|---|---|---|
| 🔴 Critical | 3 | Wrong images on all 6 product cards · Sort dropdown completely unresponsive · Last Name input overwrites First Name in checkout — all `problem_user` |
| 🟠 High | 5 | Cart limited to 3 items on `problem_user` and `error_user` · Sort triggers browser alert on `error_user` · Last Name field unresponsive on `error_user` · Sort order non-deterministic on `visual_user` |
| 🟡 Medium | 4 | Layout breaks on small screens · Sort dropdown incomplete hit area (all users) · Session expiry error message uses raw URL path · Reset App State resets badge but Remove buttons don't revert until page reload |
| 🟢 Low | 2 | No confirmation after Reset App State · No order reference number on confirmation screen |

### 🔴 Top 3 Critical Issues

**BUG-001 — Wrong image on all 6 product cards (`problem_user`)**
All product cards display the same unrelated photo — a dog with a ball — regardless of the product name. Product names and prices are correct; only images are wrong.
Root cause: Image-product mapping not applied for `problem_user`

**BUG-002 — Sort dropdown completely unresponsive (`problem_user`)**
Clicking any part of the sort dropdown has no effect — the dropdown does not open at all.
Root cause: Sort dropdown event binding disabled or missing for `problem_user`

**BUG-003 — Last Name input overwrites First Name in checkout (`problem_user`)**
Typing in the Last Name field replaces the First Name value. Last Name stays empty. Checkout cannot proceed past Step 1.
Root cause: Classic input binding bug — both fields share the same state variable

## 🔍 Notable Exploratory Findings

**Sort dropdown incomplete hit area (all users)**
The sort button shows a pointer cursor across its full visible area, but click events only register on the filter icon or text label — not the button background. Discovered during unscripted exploratory testing.

**`error_user` sort alert**
`error_user` is the only account that explicitly surfaces its sort defect via a browser alert: *"Sorting is broken! This error has been reported to Backtrace."* Unlike `problem_user` where sorting silently fails, `error_user` actively notifies the user — effectively a debug message left visible in production.
